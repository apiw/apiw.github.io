1\. So recently I've been staying home a lot and been playing a lot of games, and came accross 
this [philosophical discussion] (https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/32we4d/serious_what_requires_more_strategy_rtss_or_go/) 
about strategy, turn based games, and other types of games:  

\- Highlights from this post that I liked: <br/>
1\. `In every balanced competitive game, the game is only as difficult as your opponent. The top level Go players have put more time 
into mastering the game than the top level Starcraft players. That means, to rise to the top, it (on average) requires more 
practice/inherent skill for Go than Starcraft.` <br/>
2\. `Even with perfect strategy, you will still lose Starcraft matches if your 'micro-skills', control, reaction, etc, aren't 
good enough.`
